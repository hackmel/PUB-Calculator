# PUB-Calculator
We used this app to easily calculate and split the monthly bills within our group who lives in the same apartment.
This web app generates a monthly report that indicates the amount we need to pay per head based on the numner of days we stayed in 
the apartment  including our vistors.
This web app is coded in Java using Spring MVC to create RESTful services that will be consumed by javascrript using AJAX in the 
front end. This also utilized the use of HTML5 and CSS3.
